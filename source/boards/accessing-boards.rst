Accessing Focalboard from Mattermost
=====================================

Focalboard currently uses channel-based permissions, meaning that only members of the associated channel can access (read/write) the boards for that channel.

You can use this to create private boards:
1. Create or join a private channel (or group channel or direct-message)
2. Click on the Focalboard icon in the channel header
3. Create a board

Only members of that private channel can access the board.

You can use the share board feature to share a read-only board with anyone (incuding unauthenticated users) who has the generated link.
