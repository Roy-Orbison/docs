Accessing Focalboard from Mattermost
=====================================

Focalboard currently uses channel-based permissions, meaning that only members of the associated channel can access (read/write) the boards for that channel.

You can use this to create private boards:

1. Create or join a Private channel, Group Message, or Direct Message.
2. Select the **Focalboard Workspace** icon in the channel header.
3. Create a board.

Only members of channel you created/joined can access the board. However, you can use the share board feature to share a read-only board with anyone (incuding unauthenticated users) who has the generated link.
